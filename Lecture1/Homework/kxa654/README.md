# Marking: 

1. The program is perfect. The way to do the program is beautiful and it is the bets way to do it. Great work. 
   But, in the assignment instructions, you were supposed to create a Printer class not an Exception class.

2. The way of making the program is very good. All the parts work and it looks good too. But, when the user does not        type "Sum", "Divide", "Multiply" or "Substraction", the calculator outputs the substraction of the numbers. It would    have been better if it would say something like "invalid argument". Apart from that, BEAUTIFUL.

        Good work. But please pay attention to the intricacies if your program and the instructions. They are the things which make you perfect.
